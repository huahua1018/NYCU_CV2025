## Introduction
The goal of this assignment is to design and train a **model with ResNet as the backbone** for **image classification tasks**, where each image is assigned to one of 100 categories.
I selected ResNeXt101_32x8d as the backbone and improved its capabilities by incorporating dropout and the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM). Additionally, I applied Mixup for data augmentation. Finally, the model achieved an accuracy of 0.91 on the validation set.
